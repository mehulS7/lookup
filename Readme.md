# lookup
Lookup is a tool that helps in extracting the relevant information from the social site LinkedIN. There are many of us who use LinkedIN on daily basis and search for 
webinars, jobs, concerts, meetups and more.
To ease this process of searching and going through all the posts, I developed lookup. 

Lookup, simply needs few information like your linkedIN emailID, password, keywords and preferences. After acquiring all these details it automatically does the 
hard work for you.
In the end if you need to save the information, you can save it in a DataBase, Excel or receive it as a HTML document via Telegram.

You don't need to enter all the information everytime you need to extract data. A config file will be created in the end containing all of the essential details.

Have a look at lookup. It's working - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D9D-MdiLwA6zKH2I8zkgTrqvfteje0EV/view?usp=sharing
